# Intelligent Operator Pricing Structure

## Overview

The Intelligent Operator (I.O.) subscription system creates a tiered protocol access model where users progress from basic AI tools to full protocol ownership with governance rights. This structure incentivizes growth while providing clear value at each tier.
