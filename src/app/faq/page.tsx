      {
        id: 'what-is-unified-ai',
        question: 'What is Unified AI Protocol?',
        answer: 'Unified AI Protocol is the missing infrastructure layer that unifies AI services with decentralized identity. We provide the "connective tissue" between AI platforms, enabling seamless, secure, and user-controlled interactions across any AI service. Think of it as the internet protocol for AI - creating a unified experience where users maintain one identity across all AI interactions while earning tokens for their contributions.'
      },
      {
        id: 'how-different-from-competitors',
        question: 'How is Unified AI different from SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, or Ocean Protocol?',
        answer: 'While SingularityNET focuses on AI marketplaces, Fetch.ai on autonomous agents, and Ocean on data marketplaces, Unified AI provides the unified identity and transaction layer that these platforms lack. We complement rather than compete - enabling users to maintain one identity across SingularityNET services, Fetch agents, and Ocean data while earning unified rewards. Our Handle Registry system is the first user-centric identity solution for AI services.'
      },
      {
        id: 'main-benefits',
        question: 'What are the main benefits for users?',
        answer: 'Users get: (1) One universal AI identity across all services, (2) Complete control over their AI data and interactions, (3) Token rewards for contributing valuable data, (4) Seamless switching between AI models and services, (5) Vault-based secure storage of AI history, and (6) Governance participation in protocol decisions. Instead of managing dozens of AI accounts, you have one handle that works everywhere.'
      },
      {
        id: 'getting-started',
        question: 'How do I get started with Unified AI?',
        answer: 'Start by claiming your handle at unifiedai.com/claim - this becomes your universal AI identity. Then explore our Protocol Academy to learn about vault setup, token economics, and AI agent creation. Developers can access our APIs and SDKs, while enterprises can schedule demos for custom integrations. Join our community on Discord for real-time support and updates.'
      }
    ],
    technical: [
      {
        id: 'handle-registry-work',
        question: 'How does the Handle Registry work?',
        answer: 'The Handle Registry uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with a custom naming system. Each handle (like @yourname.ai) maps to a DID that controls your identity across all AI services. The registry supports three tiers: Developer Handles ($50-500+), AI Agent Handles ($1-5), and Endpoint Handles ($0.01/hr). Handles are stored on-chain with vault-based ownership, enabling secure, user-controlled identity management.'
      },
      {
        id: 'ai-service-integration',
        question: 'How do AI services integrate with Unified AI?',
        answer: 'AI services integrate through our API-first design with SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Go, and mobile platforms. Services authenticate users via handle resolution, access user preferences through vault APIs, and process payments through our token system. We provide middleware that existing AI platforms can plug into without changing their core architecture - making integration seamless.'
      },
      {
        id: 'security-privacy',
        question: 'How do you ensure security and privacy?',
        answer: 'Security is built into every layer: (1) Vault-based identity with user-controlled keys, (2) Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification, (3) Encrypted data storage with user-controlled access, (4) Smart contract audits and formal verification, (5) Decentralized architecture preventing single points of failure. Users control what data to share and can revoke access at any time.'
      },
      {
        id: 'scalability',
        question: 'How does Unified AI handle scalability?',
        answer: 'We use a multi-chain architecture with Cosmos-based consensus for high throughput. The Handle Registry can process thousands of identity resolutions per second, while AI service calls are routed through optimized endpoints. We employ layer-2 solutions for microtransactions and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. The system is designed to scale to millions of users and thousands of AI services.'

    ],
    tokenomics: [
      {
        id: 'three-token-system',
        question: 'How does the three-token economy work?',
        answer: 'Our ecosystem uses: (1) UtilityCoin (UC) - the base protocol token for governance and staking, (2) AI Tokens (AIT) - execution gas for AI service calls and rewards, (3) Meme Coins - viral fuel for community engagement and marketing. This creates a balanced economy where UC provides stability, AIT drives usage, and Meme Coins enable viral growth and community participation.'
      },
      {
        id: 'token-utility',
        question: 'What can I do with Unified AI tokens?',
        answer: 'UtilityCoin: Stake for governance voting, pay for premium handles, earn staking rewards, participate in protocol decisions. AI Tokens: Pay for AI service calls, earn rewards for data contributions, tip AI agents, access premium features. Meme Coins: Participate in viral campaigns, earn from social engagement, access exclusive content, boost visibility in feeds.'
      },
      {
        id: 'earning-tokens',
        question: 'How can I earn tokens?',
        answer: 'Multiple earning opportunities: (1) Contribute valuable training data to AI models, (2) Stake UtilityCoin for validation rewards, (3) Provide AI services through the platform, (4) Participate in governance and earn voting rewards, (5) Create viral content for Meme Coin rewards, (6) Refer new users and earn referral bonuses, (7) Participate in community challenges and airdrops.'
      },
      {
        id: 'token-distribution',
        question: 'How are tokens distributed?',
        answer: 'UtilityCoin: 40% community rewards, 25% ecosystem development, 20% team/advisors (4-year vest), 15% strategic reserves. AI Tokens: 50% user rewards, 25% AI service providers, 15% ecosystem growth, 10% protocol treasury. Meme Coins: 60% community airdrops, 20% viral campaigns, 15% creator rewards, 5% protocol reserves. All distributions are transparent and auditable on-chain.'

      },
      {
        id: 'token-value-accrual',
        question: 'How do tokens accrue value?',
        answer: 'Token value grows through: (1) Network usage driving demand for AI Tokens, (2) UtilityCoin staking reducing circulating supply, (3) Handle registry growth increasing utility demand, (4) Partnership integrations expanding user base, (5) Governance participation creating holding incentives, (6) Deflationary mechanisms through token burns, (7) Revenue sharing from platform fees to token holders.'
