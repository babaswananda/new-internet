    general: [
      {
        id: 'what-is-unified-ai',
        question: 'What is Unified AI Protocol?',
        answer: 'Unified AI Protocol is the missing infrastructure layer that unifies AI services with decentralized identity. We provide the "connective tissue" between AI platforms, enabling seamless, secure, and user-controlled interactions across any AI service. Think of it as the internet protocol for AI - creating a unified experience where users maintain one identity across all AI interactions while earning tokens for their contributions.'
      },
      {
        id: 'how-different-from-competitors',
        question: 'How is Unified AI different from SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, or Ocean Protocol?',
        answer: 'While SingularityNET focuses on AI marketplaces, Fetch.ai on autonomous agents, and Ocean on data marketplaces, Unified AI provides the unified identity and transaction layer that these platforms lack. We complement rather than compete - enabling users to maintain one identity across SingularityNET services, Fetch agents, and Ocean data while earning unified rewards. Our Handle Registry system is the first user-centric identity solution for AI services.'
      },
      {
        id: 'main-benefits',
        question: 'What are the main benefits for users?',
        answer: 'Users get: (1) One universal AI identity across all services, (2) Complete control over their AI data and interactions, (3) Token rewards for contributing valuable data, (4) Seamless switching between AI models and services, (5) Vault-based secure storage of AI history, and (6) Governance participation in protocol decisions. Instead of managing dozens of AI accounts, you have one handle that works everywhere.'
      },
      {
        id: 'getting-started',
        question: 'How do I get started with Unified AI?',
        answer: 'Start by claiming your handle at unifiedai.com/claim - this becomes your universal AI identity. Then explore our Protocol Academy to learn about vault setup, token economics, and AI agent creation. Developers can access our APIs and SDKs, while enterprises can schedule demos for custom integrations. Join our community on Discord for real-time support and updates.'
      }
    ],
    technical: [
      {
        id: 'handle-registry-work',
        question: 'How does the Handle Registry work?',
        answer: 'The Handle Registry uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with a custom naming system. Each handle (like @yourname.ai) maps to a DID that controls your identity across all AI services. The registry supports three tiers: Developer Handles ($50-500+), AI Agent Handles ($1-5), and Endpoint Handles ($0.01/hr). Handles are stored on-chain with vault-based ownership, enabling secure, user-controlled identity management.'
      },
      {
        id: 'ai-service-integration',
        question: 'How do AI services integrate with Unified AI?',
        answer: 'AI services integrate through our API-first design with SDKs for JavaScript, Python, Go, and mobile platforms. Services authenticate users via handle resolution, access user preferences through vault APIs, and process payments through our token system. We provide middleware that existing AI platforms can plug into without changing their core architecture - making integration seamless.'
      },
      {
        id: 'security-privacy',
        question: 'How do you ensure security and privacy?',
        answer: 'Security is built into every layer: (1) Vault-based identity with user-controlled keys, (2) Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification, (3) Encrypted data storage with user-controlled access, (4) Smart contract audits and formal verification, (5) Decentralized architecture preventing single points of failure. Users control what data to share and can revoke access at any time.'
      },
      {
        id: 'scalability',
        question: 'How does Unified AI handle scalability?',
        answer: 'We use a multi-chain architecture with Cosmos-based consensus for high throughput. The Handle Registry can process thousands of identity resolutions per second, while AI service calls are routed through optimized endpoints. We employ layer-2 solutions for microtransactions and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. The system is designed to scale to millions of users and thousands of AI services.'
      }
    ],
    partnerships: [
      {
        id: 'partnership-types',
        question: 'What types of partnerships does Unified AI offer?',
        answer: 'We offer several partnership tiers: (1) Technical Integrations - AI platforms integrating our identity layer, (2) Strategic Alliances - Joint go-to-market with complementary protocols, (3) Enterprise Partnerships - Custom solutions for large organizations, (4) Developer Partnerships - Building on our infrastructure, (5) Investment Partnerships - Token holders and governance participants. Each tier has specific benefits and requirements.'
      },
      {
        id: 'integration-process',
        question: 'What is the integration process for AI platforms?',
        answer: 'Integration follows our streamlined process: (1) Technical assessment and compatibility review, (2) API integration using our SDKs, (3) Handle Registry connection for user identity, (4) Token integration for payments and rewards, (5) Testing on our testnet environment, (6) Mainnet deployment with ongoing support. Most integrations complete within 2-4 weeks with our technical team support.'
      },
      {
        id: 'enterprise-benefits',
        question: 'What benefits do enterprise partners receive?',
        answer: 'Enterprise partners get: (1) Custom integration support and dedicated technical team, (2) White-label solutions with their branding, (3) Revenue sharing from user activity, (4) Priority access to new features and updates, (5) Governance voting rights proportional to usage, (6) Marketing co-promotion and joint announcements, (7) Technical training and ongoing support.'
      },
      {
        id: 'becoming-partner',
        question: 'How do I become a Unified AI partner?',
        answer: 'Start by scheduling a partnership demo at unifiedai.com/book-demo or contact protocol@io.unifiedai. We\'ll assess your use case, technical requirements, and integration scope. Qualified partners receive access to our partner portal, technical documentation, sandbox environment, and dedicated support team. The process typically takes 1-2 weeks from initial contact to partnership agreement.'
      }
    ],
    pricing: [
      {
        id: 'subscription-plans',
        question: 'What subscription plans are available?',
        answer: 'We offer three main plans: (1) I.O. Starter ($20/month) - Perfect for solo creators with basic AI tools, art generation, and video creation, (2) I.O. Builder ($50/month) - For creators ready to deploy AI agents with advanced features and handle discounts, (3) I.O. Master ($150/month) - Unlimited access for entrepreneurs with premium features, unlimited agents, and priority support.'
      },
      {
        id: 'early-access-pricing',
        question: 'What is Early Access Pricing?',
        answer: 'Early Access users get lifetime pricing locks - you\'ll never pay more than your initial subscription rate, even as we add new features and increase prices for new users. This includes access to .GenerateArt (replaces Midjourney), .VideoGenerator (replaces RunwayML), unlimited chat, and agent deployment capabilities.'
      },
      {
        id: 'free-trial',
        question: 'Is there a free trial available?',
        answer: 'Yes! We offer a free trial that includes limited access to our core features: basic chat functionality, sample art generation, and exploration of our agent marketplace. You can upgrade to any paid plan at any time to unlock full features and early access pricing.'
      },
      {
        id: 'payment-methods',
        question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
        answer: 'We accept all major credit cards, PayPal, and cryptocurrency payments. For enterprise customers, we also offer invoice billing and custom payment terms. All subscriptions include automatic billing with the ability to cancel anytime.'
